# i really wanted to have it calculate the distribution of things dynamically and generate this
# but the problem is that I don't have a system which is based on absolute percentages, so the
# problem is that you can't quite change absolute percentages or something
# i mean, technically it's possible to do the computation and it'd be pretty cool to be
# able to do that, and actually it's fairly trivial, but it's more effort than I'm currently
# willing to exert

Certain manifestations of this kind of event lead to significant monetary loss and often result in large public relations campaigns to recover from the damaged brand valuation. This type of event is most common with computer software and hardware, and one way to diagnose this type of event when it happens on the bootstrapping phase of a computer operating system is by looking for the POST information. Kernel varieties of this event which are unrecoverable are referred to as namesake panics in the BSD/Mach hybrid microkernel which powers Mac OS X. The infamous Disk Operating System variety of this type of event is known for its primary color backdrop and continues to plague many of the contemporary descendents of DOS with code names such as Whistler, Longhorn and Chidori.
